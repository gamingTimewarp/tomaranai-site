      <p>I. Cucumber Water, The absence of a fleeting thought. Tastes of what once was.</p>

      <p>II. What do souls contain? Thoughts and pain embodied in: Cucumber Water.</p>

      <p>III. Less taste than LaCroix, Try to recall the taste of such. Garden vegetable.</p>

      <p>IV. It brings happiness. Cucumber Water uplifts. Make merry with it.</p>

      <p>V. Why should we consume? Because it exists for us. Truly as a friend.</p>

      <p>VI. Cucumber Water. Yes, it is our dearest child. Cucumber Water!</p>

      <p>VII. Where to go from here? Beverages culminate. With that misty brew.</p>

      <p>VIII. Light rain echoed once. Now, its sound is formed in taste. Drops upon our tongues.</p>

      <p>IX. Salad on a plate. When it's gone, the plate remains. On the plate, it is.</p>

      <p>X. Imagine cucumbers. How do those dreams taste? Refreshing, I think.</p>

      <p>XI. Painting made of oil. Copied for ten thousand years. Now the thought remains.</p>

      <p>XII. Was it all a waste? It could have been a pickle. Now we drink it so.</p>

      <p>XIII. It's a happy day. A cucumber has been born. Drink that child's tears.</p>

      <p>XIV. Where did it come from? What does a cucumber mean? Taste the form of one.</p>

      <p>XV. Remember Larry? Animated children's show. Vegetables as such.</p>

      <p>XVI. Cucumber Water: A freedom that life gives us. Drink responsibly.</p>

      <p>XVII. Described to a friend, What a pickle wants to be. That is how it tastes.</p>

      <p>XVIII. Close your eyes and sleep. Eat the pickles from your dream. Then, reflect on it.</p>

      <p>XIX. Look through a window. Cucumber across the street. Taste it far away.</p>

      <p>XX. Wait for it to load. On low resolution screens. Low definition.</p>

      <p>XXI. Find the nearest clock. Pickle time in twelve hours. How does it taste now?</p>

      <p>XXII. Sent by telegram. Sir! A message now is here! TASTE THE PICKLE. STOP.</p>

      <p>XXIII. Ancient woodblock print. Squint your eyes to make it out. Looks like zucchini.</p>

      <p>XXIV. Drawn with a crayon. No reference image used. Hastily recalled.</p>

      <p>XXV. Transience in form. Flavour is absence thereof. Cucumber Water.</p>

      <p>XXVI. High school memory. On your fiftieth birthday. That recollection.</p>

      <p>XXVII. From an empty glass, An aroma ventures forth, Finding not a home.</p>

      <p>XXVIII. From another room, Cucumbers are heard and felt. Drywall in between.</p>

      <p>XXIX. Vegetables extinct. Final memory is now lost. Only words remain.</p>

      <p>XXX. From vegtable tongue, Misinterpretation fault, Lost in translation.</p>

      <p>XXXI. Cucumber Water, Acquaintance, but not a friend. Passed by on the street.</p>

      <p>XXXII. Secret bonus game. Vegetables can unlock. Enjoy your new reward.</p>

      <p>XXXIII. Black and white on screens. Silent film, the soundtrack plays. Timbre of the words.</p>

      <p>XXXIV. Pen across the page, Leaves a marking as it slips. Visage of the ink.</p>

      <p>XXXV. When was it again? Long-forgotten days of yore. But I still taste them.</p>

      <p>XXXVI. Difficult problem. What solution does it hold? Cucumber Water.</p>

      <p>XXXVII. Flashing crosswalk light. Tiny walking man is cute. It's his favourite drink.</p>

      <p>XXXVIII. Somewhere on the earth, Legends of its name ring out. Tasty beverage.</p>

      <p>XXXIX. Seek helpful guidance. Every wise sage will tell: Drink it, soon and much.</p>

      <p>XL. Gallons of it wait. Who are they so patient for? Why, it's you, my friend!</p>

      <p>XLI. Softly whispered voice. Gentle, calm, and relaxing. Feel it in your taste.</p>

      <p>XLII. Waterfalls flow down. Watch them, looking from afar. A cucumber falls.</p>

      <p>XLIII. Does it ever taste, Bitter, sweet, or savoury? Definitely not.</p>

      <p>XLIV. Laying on a bed, Only dressed with fitted sheet. So unfulfilling.</p>

      <p>XLV. Where to go from here? Destination of our lives? Cucumber Water.</p>

      <p>XLVI. When did it appear? Was it a gift from above? I don't think it was.</p>

      <p>XLVII. Left it in my car. It's been there since yesteryear. It still tastes the same.</p>

      <p>XLVIII. Heard about it once. I think that is all I need. Same experience.</p>

      <p>XLIX. What's that over there? Spot placed on the horizon. Maybe if I squint.</p>

      <p>L. Empty fruit basket. If you could eat the void, It'd be like that.</p>

      <p>LI. Credits of a film. Lo-fi remix of the theme. That, but for pickles.</p>

      <p>LII. Might I have a drink? Wait, no, not that one, please, no! Well, I guess it's fine.</p>

      <p>LIII. Dust that's on a shelf, Just been dusted yesterday. You can almost see.</p>

      <p>LIV. Faded photograph. Glimpsed from your peripheral. Cucumber still life.</p>

      <p>LV. Feel it in your bones. The tiny ones in your ear. Wait, so hear it, then?</p>

      <p>LVI. Soda that's gone flat. Literally, there's no more depth. Narratively, too.</p>

      <p>LVII. Excel spreadsheet. Default, blank, and empty cells. Tastes similarly.</p>

      <p>LVIII. Where have you all been? It's been eternities, or more. Long-forgotten age.</p>

      <p>LIX. Hidden in a cave. Behind the legendary sword. A pebble lies ignored.</p>

      <p>LX. Phantom of the night, Wakes up in the daytime, Then goes back to bed.</p>

      <p>LXI. Watch the petals fall. Listen as the streams all flow. When were you last here?</p>

      <p>LXII. Snow on Mt. Fuji. Then it melts, and flows downstream. What did it taste like?</p>

      <p>LXIII. Mist above a lake. Imagine if the mist had mist. Even thinner still.</p>

      <p>LXIV. Turning on the game, Logos before title screen. Copyright symbol.</p>

      <p>LXV. Untouched forests lie. And in them cucumbers sit. Their voices carry far.</p>

      <p>LXVI. Forgotten purpose. Ancestors are history. Cucumbers remain.</p>

      <p>LXVII. Drink, and then, rejoice. Reminisce on the times you've had. But don't stay too long.</p>

      <p>LXVIII. What is left for us? Is all of the earth explored? One frontier awaits.</p>

      <p>LXIX. You've been there before. You don't remember; you won't. But you know you have.</p>

      <p>LXX. On a busy street, A breadcrumb falls to the ground. Gone before it lands.</p>

      <p>LXXI. Long forgotten time. Ancients drink, their glasses full. We drink in their name.</p>

      <p>LXXII. Proudly raise your glass, It contains the juice of wind, Cucumber Water.</p>

      <p>LXXIII. Cryptic alphabet. Words stand out that you don't know, You still understand.</p>

      <p>LXXIV. Moonbeams softly fall, Taste them as they shine through trees. Interesting night.</p>

      <p>LXXV. Taste the empty glass. Then, imagine it was less. Still, you taste too much.</p>

      <p>LXXVI. Look into its face. Corner of the smile shines. Taste its happiness.</p>

      <p>LXXVII. Enjoy it while it lasts. Wait, is it already gone? I really can't tell.</p>

      <p>LXXVIII. Jar of pickles sits. It's been through the dishwasher. Eighteen thousand times.</p>

      <p>LXXIX. Remember the day. No, not that one, further back. Can you taste your meals?</p>

      <p>LXXX. Refreshing waves crash. You hear them from your radio. While wearing earmuffs.</p>

      <p>LXXXI. It makes me feel nice. Not wonderful, but good enough. I hope you agree.</p>

      <p>LXXXII. It's there for me, right? Somehow I can't quite recall. I'd like to think so.</p>

      <p>LXXXIII. Will I taste again? Is this the end of all flavour? No, it's coming back.</p>

      <p>LXXXIV. Look into the pond. See the reflection look back? Now, look behind it.</p>

      <p>LXXXV. Heard about it once. Maybe from a friend of yours. You want more details.</p>

      <p>LXXXVI. Static on the screen. You're not sure you heard a noise. Message from the void?</p>

      <p>LXXXVII. Doll upon a shelf. Recall the one time she blinked. Now, drink the moment.</p>

      <p>LXXXVIII. Manilla folder. Little tab sticks out the top. Important as that.</p>

      <p>LXXXIX. Flowers in a field. Lift more petals off the ground. But the basket's full.</p>

      <p>XC. Read the afterword, For the preface of the page, With the contents list.</p>

      <p>XCI. Control alt delete. But while the monitor is off. You can't really tell.</p>

      <p>XCII. Walk into a room, Then forget why you were there. Try to remember.</p>

      <p>XCIII. Christmas vacation. Try to think of where you went. In the second grade.</p>

      <p>XCIV. Don't forget the taste! I know you already have. Time to try again.</p>

      <p>XCV. Gaze into the sky. Wonder what's behind the blue? I wonder as well.</p>

      <p>XCVI. Wall of endless screens. Every one of them is turned off. Look in the top left.</p>

      <p>XCVII. Try to take a nap. Pillowcase in the laundry. Lay there anyway.</p>

      <p>XCVIII. Journey far and wide. Write your travels in a book. Read the page numbers.</p>

      <p>XCIX. You can almost see. Written on your eyelids' backs. That's the secret taste.</p>

      <p>C.(ucumber Water) Cucumber Water. That's really all there is to say. Cucumber Water.</p>
