      <p>If you've been messing around on this website, you've probably wondered at some point who this Doctor Fancyboots guy who keeps showing up is. Here's the rundown.'</p>

      <p>I invented him in March of 2024, when I had just started reading some of Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. His writing reminded me of another of my favourite sci-fi authors, Douglas Adams, and I took a particular liking to the wizard Rincewind. </p>

      <p>"'Discworld so far feels like what you would get if you switched between reading LotR and HHGttG every line.'<br>
          'Precisely why all the above should be so is not clear, but goes some way to explain why, on the Disc, the gods are not so much worshipped as blamed.'<br>
      In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move." - me, February 27, 2024</p>

      <p>As you can probably tell, I'm an aspiring writer, so I wanted to try writing excerpts in each of those author's styles. Here's what I ended up putting out:</p>
        
      <p>"Tolkien: 'I, Gontavúir, son of Gamavúir, grandchild of Grulnivúir Arleiren, shall take up the sword Knelfemêirvel (which is in the common tongue the Blade of the Vengeance of Glory and Darkness) and fight for the honour of my people as my family has done since the Latter Ancient Days.'<br><br>
      Adams:'I have come to obtain my Asteroidal Licensing Permit.' 'Oh, that's at the Intergalatic Bureau of Permits. This is the Intergalatic Bureau of Licenses.' 'Can you direct me?' 'I can, but I'd need a release from the Intergalatic Bureau of Releases.' 'Can they get me one?' 'Not without a Permit for Release from the Intergalatic Bureau of Permits.' (It's just Monty Python in space.)<br><br>

      Pratchett: 'I have come to file my taxes.' 'Dr. Fancyboots, you know you can't file your taxes on a Tuesday while the sun is closest to the Fourth Farthest Island of the Inner Rimlands. Place your sword at my feet so I can measure your combat.' 'You know the Mystical Wizard of Revenue won't let me do so unless I have stamped approval from the Oracle of the Mysterious Beasts.'" - me, March 4th, 2024</p>

      <p>The moment I wrote that, I became instantly enamoured with the concept of a space wizard by the name of Fancyboots, so I wrote a brief paragraph describing him:</p>

      <p>"Doctor Fancyboots was not called such because he wore fancy boots, but rather because he fancied boots. The shoes he regularly wore were of an elvish sort, more akin to an arthritic seal making its dying plea to its family to carry on its legacy through the family masory business, than to any sort of cowboy footwear." - me, March 4th, 2024<br></p>

      <p>And I felt that a character that silly had a lot of potential to fit my writing style, so I immediately started writing a short story starring him, and the rest is history. He would go on to <a href="story-postdicament.html">battle amnesia on a global holiday</a>, <a href="story-antedicament.html">face the most ancient and terrifying of all evils</a>, and <a href="story-spaghetti-eastern.html">get caught up in a territory battle between gangsters</a>. Stay tuned to see what he gets into next: soon, he'll be making his long form debut in a full length Dr. Fancyboots novel.</p>
